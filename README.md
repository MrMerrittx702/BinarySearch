# BinarySearch

Directions  
========== 

Edit this file: --> BinarySearch/src/main/java/BinarySearch.java
All necessary imports have been made in the .java files. You should not need to import additional packages. 

  
You are tasked with implementing an overloaded method called binarySearch. The first method accepts traditional arrays, and the second method accepts arraylists. 
Implement each method by writting a binary search algorithm that will correctly return the index of the searched element. If the searched element does not appear in the array/arraylist return -1. You may implement the method using iteration or recursion. 


Preconditions:
Assume both the array and arraylists have already been sorted. You do not need to implement a sorting algorithm.
